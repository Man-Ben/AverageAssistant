The purpose of this project

This project was built to help students manage their grades and calculate their averages, and calculate how many good grades are needed to
reach a higher average.

Used tools

.NET MAUI, C#, ChatGPT-5 - I didn't just copy and pasted!

Main features:

- Average calculation.
- Corrected average calculation (if necessary).
- Counting the number of good grades needed to correction (if necessary).
- Displaying the grades, subject and class.
- Multiple average systems: English, Hungarian and Romanian.
- The Romanian system has two extras: in this system the students are needed as many grades as many hours they have + 3 per lesson.
So, implemented a feature that displays if they have enough grades or not.
- Data saving.
- Data reading.
- App theme changing.
- Easy data deletion and modification.

Plans for the future:

- Fixing the remaining issues.
- Adding new average systems.
- Adding utility for teachers.
- Adding log pages for multiple users.
- Update the UI.
- Adding extra options in Setting - default average system, for example.

  Existing issues:

- The 'NumberOfLessons' and 'NumberOfGradesWarning' fields do not display correctly when the data was loaded from file. Cause: unknown
- After editing, the old data remains on the screen. After restarting the app it disappears. Cause: unknown

About me

My name is Benjamin Man. I'm a 17 years-old student at 'Németh László' highschool in Romania. I started learning programing when was 14-15.
My first programing langueges: C++ and C#. And this is my first UI app.


The story behind the project

As a student I know very well how annoying can be to calculate an average. Checking my report card, memorizing my grades and then calculate 
it with the calculator was to much work for my lazy head. I got an idea: what if I make an app, that helps students to calculate their 
averages. So, I started the project. The first version was written in C++, and it was a simple console app. When I reported this to my IT 
teacher she told me that: 'Why are you struggling with this? Use excel.' The answer for this question is simple: if I use excel 
I'll learn nothing about coding. If I make this project, I'll learn a lot.
When I finished the project, I showed it to my friends. One of them said 'Why is this so black?'. After a good laugh - she didn't know that
that black thing was the terminal - I took in considaration, that I make a UI for my app. I searched up what possibilities I have. I found
the .NET MAUI intresting and easy to use - it wasn't. In this period, I heard about hackathons. So, I decided that I learn the basics, and
than join in a hackathon. After a while I found the 'Youth Coders Hackathon' and joined.
The Average Assistant 2.0 is the fruit of 2 months hard work and learning.

What I learned

As I said above, I used AI while working, but I wrote every single line with my own hands. ChatGPT just helped and taught me. 
Thanks to it and to Microsoft documentations I learned the folowings:

- What is OOP and how it works.
- How to handle Json files.
- What is a good project architecture.
- Patience and percistence.
